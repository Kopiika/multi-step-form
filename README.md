## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete each step of the sequence
- Go back to a previous step to update their selections
- See a summary of their selections on the final step and confirm their order
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
  - A step is submitted, but no selection has been made

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript vanilla

### What I learned

Through this project, I learned to:

- Structure and manage multi-step form logic

- Dynamically update content and UI based on user interactions

- Implement form validation and visual feedback

- Work with conditionals and DOM traversal in JavaScript

- Improve accessibility and user experience with thoughtful design


### Continued development

As I continue building projects, I want to focus on improving and deepening my understanding of the following areas:

- ðŸ§© **JavaScript structure & modularity** â€“ organizing code into reusable functions and possibly exploring modules for better scalability.
- ðŸŽ¨ **UI transitions** â€“ refining smooth visual changes when toggling content, especially to avoid layout "jumps."
- ðŸ§ª **Form validation** â€“ mastering both built-in HTML validation and creating custom, user-friendly validation messages.
- ðŸ“¦ **State management** â€“ handling form data more efficiently across steps, possibly introducing localStorage or a state manager.
- ðŸ”€ **Accessibility (a11y)** â€“ ensuring that the form is usable with keyboard navigation and screen readers.


### Useful resources

- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_switch.asp) - This helped me with the toggle switch implementation. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_grid_layout) - This is an amazing article that helped me finally understand  how grid properties work. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
